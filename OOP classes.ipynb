    "In Procedural-Oriented Programming, the program is organized as a sequence of instructions or procedures (also called functions). The focus is on functions (or procedures) that operate on data. The data is often stored separately from the functions, and functions act directly on data to perform operations.\n",

    "### Key Features:\n",
    "Modularity: Functions can be reused in different parts of the program.\n",
    "Top-Down Approach: The program is divided into small functions or procedures.\n",
    "No Encapsulation: Data and functions are separate, and there’s no strict data protection.\n",
